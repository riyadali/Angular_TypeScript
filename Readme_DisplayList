In this page, you'll display a list of heroes, and allow users to select a hero and display the hero's details.

  + Create mock heroes.  You'll need some heroes to display.  Eventually you'll get them from a remote data server. For now, 
you'll create some mock heroes and pretend they came from the server.  Create a file called mock-heroes.ts in the src/app/ folder. 
Define a HEROES constant as an array of ten heroes and export it. The file should look like this.

    src/app/mock-heroes.ts

    import { Hero } from './hero';

    export const HEROES: Hero[] = [
    
  { id: 11, name: 'Mr. Nice' },
  { id: 12, name: 'Narco' },
  { id: 13, name: 'Bombasto' },
  { id: 14, name: 'Celeritas' },
  { id: 15, name: 'Magneta' },
  { id: 16, name: 'RubberMan' },
  { id: 17, name: 'Dynama' },
  { id: 18, name: 'Dr IQ' },
  { id: 19, name: 'Magma' },
  { id: 20, name: 'Tornado' }
  
];
+ Show the hero object.  Update the binding in the template to announce the hero's name and show both id and name in a details layout like this:

    heroes.component.html (HeroesComponent's template)

     &lt;h2&gt;{{ hero.name }} Details &lt;/h2&gt;
     
     &lt;div&gt; &lt;span&gt;id:  &lt;/span&gt;{{hero.id}} &lt;/div&gt;
     
     &lt;div&gt; &lt;span&gt;name:  &lt;/span&gt;{{hero.name}} &lt;/div&gt;
    
  + The browser refreshes and display's the hero's information.
  
  + Format with the UppercasePipe.  Modify the hero.name binding like this.

    &lt;h2&gt;{{ hero.name | uppercase }} Details&lt;/h2&gt;
