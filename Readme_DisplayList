# Angular_TypeScript
Repository for all things Angular.  This is basically a starting point for all resources related to Angular 2 and above (i.e. TypeScript version of Angular)

_ A good starting point may be this tutorial https://angular.io/tutorial (you can interactively edit it and see what happens)

# Display a list of heroes
In this page, you'll display a list of heroes, and allow users to select a hero and display the hero's details.
_ Create mock heroes.  You'll need some heroes to display.  Eventually you'll get them from a remote data server. For now, 
you'll create some mock heroes and pretend they came from the server. 
    + Create a file called mock-heroes.ts in the src/app/ folder. 
    + Define a HEROES constant as an array of ten heroes and export it. The file should look like this.

            src/app/mock-heroes.ts
            import { Hero } from './hero';
            export const HEROES: Hero[] = [    
                { id: 11, name: 'Mr. Nice' },
                { id: 12, name: 'Narco' },
                { id: 13, name: 'Bombasto' },
                { id: 14, name: 'Celeritas' },
                { id: 15, name: 'Magneta' },
                { id: 16, name: 'RubberMan' },
                { id: 17, name: 'Dynama' },
                { id: 18, name: 'Dr IQ' },
                { id: 19, name: 'Magma' },
                { id: 20, name: 'Tornado' }  
            ];
